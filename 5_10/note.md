# Chapter 2 - The Problem: The Heart of the research process

# State the Hypothesis and/or Research Questions
- Hypothesis are essential to experimental research; research questions are more common in qualitative research
- Both hypothesis and research questions provide guidance for the kind of data that should be collected
- Both hypothesis and research questions suggest how data should be analyze and interpreted
- Both hypothesis may originate in the subproblems
- Both hypothesis and research problem provide a position from which the researcher may initiate an exploration of the problem

# Distignuishing Null Hypothesis
- Null hypothesis: 
		- A statement that there will be no difference between groups
		- no consistent relationships between variable
		- no statistical significance between the two variables

## Example

### Not Null Example
- student enrolled in program A graduate at a higher rate compared to students enrolled in program B 

### Null example
- there will be no difference in graduation rates of students enrolled in program A and program B

# Identifying varibles under investigation
- A variable is quality or characteristic in a research investigation that has two or more possible values
	- Independent variable - variable that the researcher studies as a possible cause of something else; this is the one that the researcher manipulates
	- Dependant variable - variable that is potentially influenced by the independent
	- Mediating variable - come to stage when independent variable influence dependant variable indirectly

# Why Identify variables ?
## Identification is helpful in choosing
- an appropriate research design

# Importance of the study
- Discuss the reasons for undertaking the study
- Studies should not go far beyond any relationsship to the practical world; they must have a practical value

# Hypothesis example
- Trout suffers more lice when in low water condition because there is less oxygen in the water

# Question based on the given article
1. Discuss the research problems identified by the researcher
2. Explain the hypothesis of this research worko
3. Elaborate the researh objective and the research scope
4. Describe the research methodology deployed
5. Discuss the main contribution from this research
