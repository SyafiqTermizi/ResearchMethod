# Chapter 2: The problem (Heart of the research)

what is the topic ?
what is the main idea/issue ?

## Finding research projects
there are 2 types of of research
1. Basic research - intended to enhance basic knowledge or shed light on a phenomena
2. Applied research - intended to address issues that have immediate relevance to current practices, procedures and policies. intended to human decision making about practical problems; ocasionaly address questions one's immediate work environment (action research)

## Criteria for identification of a suitable research problem
1. The research problem should address an important question so that the answer will make a difference.
2. The research problem should advance the frontiers of knowledge by leading to new ways of thinking, suggesting possible application, or paving new way for further research in the field

## Situasions to avoid when considering a research problem
- Research project should not be a ruse for achieving self-enlightenment
- A problem whose sole purpose is to compare two sets of data is not suitable for a research problem
- Calculating a correlation coefficient between two sets of data to show a relationship between them is not acceptable as a research problem
- Problem that result in a yes or no answer is not suitable for research

## Finding a legitimate research problem
1. Look around you
	- find weakness and strength in previous research
2. Read the literature
	- Address suggestions for future work identified in LR
	- Replicate a research project in different settings
	- Consider various subpopulations might behave differently
	- Apply an existing perspective or theory to a new situation
	- Explore unsuspected or contradictory findings in previous studies
	- Challenge research findings that seems to contradict what you know or believe to be true
3. Attend proffessional conferences
4. Seek the advice of the experts
5. Choose topic that ingtrigues and motivates you
6. Choose a topic that others will find interesting and worthy of attention

## Guidelines: stating the research problem
1. State the problem clearly and completely
2. Think through the feasibility of the proejct that the problem implies
3. Say precisely what you mean
4. State the problem in a way that reflects an open mind about its solution
5. Edit your work

## Example of research problem
Various protocol must be used in a hetergoenous network.
The complexity of the protocols increases as the number of devices increases.
Hence, it should be a method to reduce the complexity of the protocols
