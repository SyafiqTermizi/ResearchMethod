# definition of research
- a systematic process of collection, analyzing & interpreting information to increase understading of a phenomenon about which we are interested

collect (information gathering)		->	 analyze (technique)	 ->	 interpret 	-> 	solution

# what research is not
- merely gathering information
- merely rummaging around for hard-to-locate information

# characteristic of research
- originate with a question or problem
- requires clear articulation of a goal
- usually divides the principal problem into more manageble subproblem
- is guided by the specific research problem, question or hypothesis
- requires a specific plan for processing
- accept certain critical assumption

# hypothesis
- a logical supposition, a reasonable guess, an educated conjecture
- provides a tentative explanation for a phenomenon under investigation
- may direct thinking to possible sources of information necessary to resolve the research problem and its subproblems

# research tools
- specific mechanisms or strategies used to collect, manipulate, or interpret dat

# research methodology
- the general approach the researcher takes in carrying out the research project. this approact dictates the particular tools the researcher selects

# six tools of research
1. the library and its resources
2. computer technology
3. measurement
4. statistic
5. language
6. the human mind

# library and its resources
- access to microforms, compact disks, online databases
- fast and efficient means of locating and accessing information on virtually any topic
- access to library holdings around the world

# human mind as a tool of research
- critical thinking
- deductive logic
- inductive reasoning
- the scientific thinking

# communicating effectively through writing
- use concrete examples to make abstract ideas more understandable
- use appropriate punctiation
- use figures and tables for clarification
- at the end of the chapters and major sections, summarize what you have said
- anticipate having to write mulitple draft
